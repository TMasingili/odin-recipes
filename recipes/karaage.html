        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Karaage (唐揚げ, 空揚げ, or から揚げ, [kaɾa aɡe]) is a Japanese cooking technique 
            in which various foods—most often chicken, but also other meat and fish—are deep fried in oil. 
            The process involves lightly coating small pieces of the meat or fish with flour, or potato or corn starch,
            and frying in a light oil.

                    Set up your dredging station. Place a wire rack over a foil-lined baking sheet.
                    Add potato starch to a wide, shallow bowl.

                    Remove chicken from the refrigerator. Stir to coat with marinade.
                    Toss 2 or 3 pieces at a time in the potato starch until evenly coated.
                    Shake off any excess starch and place chicken on the wire rack. Repeat to dredge remaining pieces.

                        Tap the rack on the baking sheet to remove any loose chunks of starch,
                         then transfer the baking sheet and rack of chicken to the refrigerator for 15 to 30 minutes.
